# 30_Days_MyDFIR_Microsoft_Challenge
This repository documents my 30-day hands-on journey exploring the Microsoft 365 E5 ecosystem, including Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, Defender XDR, and Intune.

Goal: To develop practical, job-ready skills in security operations, focusing on investigations, analysis, and incident response, while building a strong portfolio for SOC roles.
